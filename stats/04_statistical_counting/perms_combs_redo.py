Factorial
- provides cardinality nPk where n == k

def factorial(num):
    prod = 1

Permutations
nPk = n! / (n-k)!
if k==n =>
    5! / (5-5)!
    5! / 0!
    120 / 1

You have 10 students and you are conducting a science fair where 4 students will win
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th. How many different arrangements of those 4 winners is possible?

Permutations Intuition
- count normally
- reduce the space by eliminating duplicates

Five pets and 5 beds. What are all the ways that you can
arrange those 5 pets in 5 beds?
