Geometric
- models the number of failures up until the first success
    - k means one of two things
        - the number of bernoulli trial failures before the first success
          or
        - the number of bernoulli trials up to and including the first success

'''
Write the geometric_pmf function
3 parameters
p : probability
k : number of failures (inclusive or exclusive of the 1st success)
inclusive=True : whether or not to use inclusive or exclusive pmf

def geometric_pmf(p, k, inclusive=True):
